# MyReads Project

This app allows the user to categorize books according to status: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read" and "Read" - kind of like a personal "playlist" for books!  

The main page displays the user's books by category.  The main page also has a link to the search page, where the user can search the database for more books to add to the main page, and categorize them appropriately.

To use the app:

1. Download or clone this project from [git].

2. To install app: from the command line, type: npm install.

3. When complete, to run app, type: npm start and view the app in your favorite browser.
